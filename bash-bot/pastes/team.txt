Team one had a chance
now but they were
not feeling it anymore
so they felt like
it should be made
more interesting
and so what they
did was to
make small changes
in their game to
make sure it was
moving smoothly
when it got to
the end they rushed
team three and they
made sure team two
saw it which would
in turn have them
forfeit when they
rushed team three
they took their
pens out, and they
inked their way to
their flesh and the
people watching in
horror had these
faces only the dark
could describe as
horrific, but that was
that and they won as
they have before!
